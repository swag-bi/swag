# Demo of the SWAG-BI prototype

We created a demo video in order to illustrate our SWAG-BI proof-of-concept prototype.
The demo introduces the main features of the SWAG-BI system, which also resemble the underlying theoretical concepts of semantic web analysis graphs (SWAG).

The demo employs the asylum applications multidimensional (MD) schema which comprises the Asylum Applications cube that measures the Number of Asylum Applications by Citizenship, Destination, Age Group, Time, Sex, and Application Type.

The video first presents an introduction to using the system, and, afterwards, presents an example semantic web analysis graph defined on top of the asylum applications MD schema.
The SWAG mainly investigates the number of asylum applications with an emphasis on destination and time aspects of applications.
The SWAG is explained in detail and instantiated step by step.

The used data are an extraction of asylum applications data of years 2014 and 2015, and are only intended for illustration purposes.
