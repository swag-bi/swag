# Demo

We have created a demo video to illustrate our proof-of-concept prototype of the semantic web analysis graphs (SWAG).
We employ the asylum applications cube which measures the number of asylum applications, classified by citizenship, destination, age group, time, sex, and application type.
The video tracks the execution of a SWAG using the prototype.
The used SWAG investigates the number of asylum applications with an emphasis on destination and time of the applications.
As the analysis proceeds, finer-grained details become involved.
The used data are an extraction of asylum applications data of years 2014 and 2015. 
Data are only intended only for illustration purposes - provided with no guarantees.
