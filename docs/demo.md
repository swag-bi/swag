# Demo

We created a demo video in order to illustrate our proof-of-concept prototype SWAG-BI.
The demo introduces the main features of the SWAG-BI system, which also resemble the underlying theoretical concepts of semantic web analysis graphs (SWAG).
The demo employs a multidimensional (MD) schema on asylum applications.
The schema comprises the Asylum Applications cube which measures the Number of Asylum Applications by Citizenship, Destination, Age Group, Time, Sex, and Application Type.

The video first presents an introduction to using the system.
Afterwards, an example semantic web analysis graph defined on top of the asylum applications MD schema is explained in detail and instantiated step by step.
The SWAG mainly investigates the number of asylum applications with an emphasis on destination and time aspects of the applications.

The used data are an extraction of asylum applications data of years 2014 and 2015, and are only intended for illustration purposes.
